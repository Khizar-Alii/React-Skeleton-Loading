# React-Skeleton-Loading
This React app features a dynamic homepage that loads user data from an API, and a contact form with state management using reducers.

The app appears to be a basic React application that uses React Router for client-side routing. It consists of three main components: the Navbar component, the Home component, and the Contact component. 

The Navbar component provides a basic navigation bar for the app, allowing users to easily navigate to the Home, About, and Contact pages. 

The Home component fetches data from an API endpoint using Axios, and displays a list of users with their names, email addresses, and addresses. To provide a better user experience, the component displays a skeleton loading screen while the data is being fetched from the API. 

The Contact component provides a basic form for users to fill out and submit a message to the site's administrators. The form's state is managed using the useReducer hook, and the submitted message is displayed on the page once the form is successfully submitted.

Overall, the app provides a basic starting point for a React-based web application that can be expanded and customized to meet the needs of a specific project.
